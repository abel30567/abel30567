### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently working on a new trading card game called <a href="http://primaltcg.com">Primal Trading Card Game</a>. Where a group of pirates and dragonic hosts try to save the Arizal kingdom from a plague-crazed clergy that aims to control all the citizens in Arizal to become the clergy's puppets by controlling the kingdom's strongest beasts.

My development specialty is focused on React and React Native applications and I prefer to work with Node.js but I can work with several backend languages.
